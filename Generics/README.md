# Notes

## What is Generics?
In C#, generic means not specific to a particular data type.
Generics make it possible to design interfaces, classes, methods, events, and delegates that defer the specification of one or more types until the class or method is declared and instantiated.
A type parameter is a placeholder for a particular type specified when creating an instance of the generic type.
It maximizes code reuse, type safety, and performance.
