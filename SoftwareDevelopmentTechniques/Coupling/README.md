## What is Coupling?
Here is the classic definition of coupling - It is the degree to which the software components depend on each other.
Coupling in C# describes the relationship between modules in C#, how the classes and objects are connected, and also how dependent they are on each other. This also describes the flexibility and reusability part of the code.
A coupling as such is needed for successful communication between modules. But, how the modules are coupled determine the standard of the code. Let's see in detail the two types of coupling now.

## Tightly Coupled
Think of it this way - your fingers are tightly coupled with the hand, which makes it hard to change the position of the fingers and their location. This means that changing the position of fingers is close to impossible and requires redesigning of the hand. This is an example of being tightly coupled.
The classes and objects are very much interdependent, so it becomes difficult to reuse the code. When there are many dependent components, then it becomes difficult to maintain the code for enhancements.
Let us take an example, to understand things better.

## Loosely Coupled
Loosely coupled can be explained with the help of head as an example. Take any type of hat, you will be able to fit it on your head. For example, a cowboy hat can fit on top of it, so can a chef's hat. Here, the head and the cap are loosely coupled as both are not interdependent. This makes it much less complex and ensures code reusability.
From a code perspective, the class and objects are not interdependent so it becomes easy to replace, reuse, maintain the code. Let's see how to achieve the same functionality(discussed in the previous section) using loosely coupled code.
